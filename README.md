# OctoSpacc UserCSS

A collection for all my UserCSS styles.

I suggest using the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) extension to apply them in your browser.

Only my 100% original styles are licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license.  
This means, not every style in this repo: for those not made from scratch, but starting from someone else's code, proper credits are indicated in the source files and I don't change the license.
